### Hi, I'm Calla

I'm an aspiring software developer who is currently on the School of Code (https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk/) 16-week bootcamp. 

Previous to my coding journey, I spent a few years working in market research, which was partly influenced by the fact that I did a research-focused masters. Although I enjoyed what I did, I always felt like I wasn't challenging myself enough and always planned on making a move into tech when I had a chance. I've always been super interested in tech - mainly through gaming but I'm also a co-author on a published book on Virtual Reality and how it can be used in social science research (https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk/). I found the School of Code through a mutual friend who was a graduated bootcamper, and felt it was the perfect opportunity for me to make my first steps into the tech world. 

Feel free to have a look through my repos to see my progress, and check me out on LinkedIn ðŸ˜„ (https://www.linkedin.com/in/calla-sullivan-drage-88a7a5139/).
